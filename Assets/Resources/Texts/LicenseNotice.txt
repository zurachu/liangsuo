You may use DOTween Pro version (the "Software") in commercial and non-commercial applications created with Unity as long as every person working on the Unity project has a valid DOTween Pro license*.
You may not distribute the Software nor portions of the Software inside Unity plugins unless authorized by the Software's copyright owner, in which case you will have to include this copyright notice along all copies of the Software and the original readme.txt file.

* NOTE: the license has changed due to Unity's Asset Store rules: previously it allowed the use of DOTween as long as only one person per Unity project had one license. If you got DOTween Pro before June 2015 contact me and I'll deal with it
